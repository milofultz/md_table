Markdown Table Maker
---

I use nvALT for my note taking with my Zettelkasten and it uses MultiMarkdown. I love using markdown but making tables is still something that is really hard to format yourself. I wanted to make a tool that could automatically format small amounts of incoming data into a readable markdown table.

Currently, it asks you for how many columns you want, the header for each one, and the data for each one, and it outputs a .md file that you can copy the contents from into whatever note taking app you use.
